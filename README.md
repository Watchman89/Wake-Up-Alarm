# Wake-Up-Alarm
Project to create a alarm application for Android phones.
Inspiration has come from the standard Android 'Clock' application and VIXJS application named 'Zelda Alarm Clock'.

Description of desired features:
Two main windows, changable from a bar on the bottom of the screen.
Window 1:
- Ability to add/remove and change the settings of an unlimited amount of alarms.
- Alarms having these settings:
● A variable time, chosen by the user. (07:00 , 16:00)
● Choice on which days the alarm goes off. (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU)
● A variable alarm sound, chosen by the user.
● A variable wallpaper and text shown when the alarm goes off, chosen by the user.
- Wallpapers and sounds used by alarms must be loaded from internal storage.
- On the alarm screen, a standard wallpaper must be shown.
Window 2:
- Selection bar to change the standard wallpaper.
- Slider to change the alarm's maximal volume.
- Slider to change the alarm's snooze time.
- Slider to change the alarm's fade-in time. (time until maximal volume is reached, volume increasing linear)
The alarm itself:
- Displays custom wallpaper and text, plays custom sound.
- Two buttons are shown on screen: Stop and Snooze.
- Alarm will sound again in 5 minutes if Snooze button is touched.
- Alarm will stop if Stop button is touched.
The selection of wallpapers and sounds:
- Preferrably opened from within the application.
- A single wallpaper and sound are always loaded together, as a set.
- A credits.txt file will be placed inside every set, giving credits to the makers of both the other files.
- The user can choose a set to show for every alarm.
- The user can also choose to display a random set, picked out of a folder.
